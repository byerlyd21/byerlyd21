- 👋 Hi, I’m Dallin!

# About Me
- I am a computer science student at Utah State University who loves the outdoors, good books, and learning new things! In my free time,
  I like to mountian bike, swim, and go to the gym. I’m interested in learning more about AI/ML, fintech, as well as improving and expanding my
  technical skills. I am a intern at Eagle Rock Properties and collaborator for the brand new AI Buisness Integration Club at Utah State.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javaScript (please save me), but I still prefer Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything! I want all the experience I can get! 
- 📫 How to reach me: Shoot me an email at dallinbyerly@gmail.com, I love meeting new people!
