# 👋 Hi, I’m Dallin!
- I am a computer science student at Utah State University who loves the outdoors, good books, and learning new things! In my free time,
  I like to snowboard, mountian bike, swim, and go to the gym. I love playing intermural sports at Utah State like flag football, softball
  and volleyball. I also enjoy beating my girlfriend in pickelball 😁. My favorite programming language is Python, and I enjoy solving challenging
  puzzels and riddels. I am a intern at Eagle Rock Properties and a collaborator for the brand new AI Buisness Integration Club at Utah State as well.

# Interests 🏋️🏈🏂
- I’m interested in learning more about AI/ML, fintech, as well as improving and expanding my technical skills. Although I am always capivated
  by new technology, I am also interested in space, physics and biology. Two of my favorite classes/courses I have ever taken were AP Physics, and
  bioethics. Along with improving my technical skills, I value personal growth in the realm of mental health and physical health. I am interested
  in finding the right work-life balance, when it comes to school and jobs alike.
